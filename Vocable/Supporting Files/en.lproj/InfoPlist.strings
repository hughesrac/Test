/* Camera usage description */
NSCameraUsageDescription = "Vocable uses ARKit, a head tracking tool that relies on your device's TrueDepth front camera to detect mininal changes in head orientation and position. This allows users with limited mobility to control an on-screen pointer to interact with app. Camera data is used expressly for controlling the on-screen pointer. This data is not stored or transmitted in any way. Vocable needs permission to use the camera for this purpose.";
